Chomp:

From Wikipedia: Chomp is a two-player strategy game played on a
rectangular grid made up of smaller square cells, which can be
thought of as the blocks of a chocolate bar.
The players take it in turns to choose one block and "eat it"
(remove from the board), together with those that are above it and to its right.
The bottom left block is "poisoned" and the player who eats this loses.

How To Play:

Two players take turns 'eating' the chocolate. Click on any square
on the grid to 'eat' it. If the current player eats a
'poisoned' grid, the other player wins the game.
